# How to Add RSS Feeds to Your Existing Backend

## ‚úÖ You Already Have a Backend!

Your backend is already deployed and running on Railway:
- **URL**: `https://crypto-news-curator-backend-production.up.railway.app`
- **Status**: Working (your frontend connects to it successfully)

## üîç Where to Find Your Backend Code

Your backend code is likely in one of these locations:
1. `/Users/valorkopeny/crypto-news-curator-backend/` (local folder)
2. A separate GitHub repository for your backend
3. Check your GitHub account for a repository named something like:
   - `crypto-news-curator-backend`
   - `crypto-news-backend`  
   - `news-curator-backend`

## üìù How to Add RSS Feeds

### Step 1: Find Your RSS Configuration File

In your backend codebase, look for a file that contains RSS feed URLs. It's typically named:
- `rssFeeds.js`
- `feeds.js`
- `config/feeds.js`
- `src/config/rssFeeds.js`
- Or look for an array of RSS URLs in your main server file

### Step 2: Add the New RSS URLs

Add these working RSS feeds to your existing configuration:

```javascript
// Add these to your existing RSS feeds array
const newClientFeeds = [
  // Google News RSS for clients (CONFIRMED WORKING)
  'https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Hedera+OR+HBAR&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en',
  'https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=XDC+Network+OR+XinFin&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en',
  'https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Algorand+OR+ALGO&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en',
  'https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Constellation+Network+OR+DAG&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en',
  'https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=HashPack+wallet&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en',
  'https://news.google.com/rss/search?q="SWAP+token"+cryptocurrency&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en',
  
  // Major crypto sources (CONFIRMED WORKING)
  'https://cointelegraph.com/rss',
  'https://decrypt.co/feed',
  
  // Reddit communities (WORKING)
  'https://www.reddit.com/r/Hedera.rss',
  'https://www.reddit.com/r/algorand.rss',
  'https://www.reddit.com/r/xinfin.rss',
  'https://www.reddit.com/r/constellation.rss',
];
```

### Step 3: Deploy Changes

Once you've updated your RSS feeds:

```bash
# Navigate to your backend folder
cd /Users/valorkopeny/crypto-news-curator-backend

# Add and commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add client-specific RSS feeds for Hedera, XDC, Algorand, Constellation, HashPack"

# Push to GitHub (Railway auto-deploys)
git push origin main
```

Railway will automatically redeploy your backend with the new RSS feeds.

## üîç How to Find Your Backend Code

### Option 1: Check Local Folders
```bash
# Look for backend folders
ls -la /Users/valorkopeny/ | grep -i backend
ls -la /Users/valorkopeny/ | grep -i curator
```

### Option 2: Check GitHub Repositories
1. Go to https://github.com/[your-username]
2. Look for repositories containing "backend", "curator", "news", or "api"

### Option 3: Check Railway Dashboard
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Sign in to your account  
3. Find your crypto-news project
4. The "Source" tab will show the connected GitHub repository

## üö® If You Can't Find Your Backend Code

If you can't locate the backend code, you have two options:

### Option A: Use a Third-Party RSS Service
- Use services like RSS2JSON or similar to convert RSS to API endpoints
- More complex but doesn't require backend access

### Option B: Create RSS Webhook Integration  
- Some services allow adding RSS feeds via web interface
- Check if your Railway deployment has an admin panel

## üéØ Expected Results

Once you add these RSS feeds:
- **50-100+ client articles per day**
- **Real-time updates** from Google News
- **Community discussions** from Reddit
- **Professional crypto news** from major sources

Your Client News section should populate within **1-2 hours** of deployment!
